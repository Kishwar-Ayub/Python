    "\n",
    "# Q2\n",
    "# * It provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes in which implementation details are hidden\n",
    "# * Objects can also be reused within an across applications.\n",
    "# * It makes software easier to maintain.\n",
    "# * Reuse also enables faster development.\n",

    "# Q3\n",
    "# ** Method is called on an onject, unlike functions.\n",
    "# ** A method may alter an object's position, but function usually only operates on it, and then prints something or returns a value.\n",
